### What is the project about?
---

- The only reason for creating this repository was to keep all of my favorite and most useful GPT prompts in one place. 

- So I decided that using the GitHub Pages resource to store a site with conveniently sorted tooltips was a great idea.  You can go to the site by following <a target="_blank" href="https://pink-doublethink.github.io/lovely-prompts/" rel="nofollow">this link.</a>
