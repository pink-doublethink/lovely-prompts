### What is the project about?
---

- The only reason I created this repository was to keep all of my favorite and most useful prompts in one place. I wanted to have no need to log in to a friend's place to get access to the prompts I need. 

- Then I decided that using the GitHub Pages resource to store a site with conveniently sorted prompts was a great idea. You can go to the site by following <a target="_blank" href="https://pink-doublethink.github.io/lovely-prompts/" rel="nofollow">this link.</a>
