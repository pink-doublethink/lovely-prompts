Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections: a) your best possible current suggestion b) question (ask just one most powerful question pertaining to what will lead me to my wholeness and insight) 3.

Translate them to English and create a summary of all the reviews in English and list them as Pros and Cons in the bullet point format. Remember that each bullet point should be one sentence or at max two short sentences. Most frequently mentioned should come first in each list and every bullet point should have a percentage showing how much evidence the reviews have brought for that pro or con. For example if reviews are mentioning that product is going bad easily and they brought some reasons for what they are saying, the percentage of your confidence should go higher, but if there are some reviews which are unsure about something or there are no evidence or it's not repeated frequently then the percentage should go lower. At the end you should write a paragraph about what I should pay attention to, before buying this product. These can be some warnings or some tips or some suggestions, points that I will miss, or anything that you think is important to know before buying this product.

                                        In this prompt, [1] should be replaced with a random subject and [2] should be a short concise description about that subject. Be specific and detailed in your descriptions, using descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a wide range of vocabulary, and sensory language. Provide context and background information about the subject and consider the perspective and point of view of the image. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more specific and dynamic.
                                        <br><br>  
                                        [3] should be a short concise description about the environment of the scene. Consider the overall tone and mood of the image, using language that evokes the desired emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting in vivid, sensory terms, using specific details and adjectives to bring the scene to life.

                                        [4] should be a short concise description about the mood of the scene. Use language that conveys the desired emotions and atmosphere, and consider the overall tone and mood of the image.

                                        [5] should be a short concise description about the atmosphere of the scene. Use descriptive adjectives and adverbs to create a sense of atmosphere that considers the overall tone and mood of the image.
                                        <br><br>
                                        [6] should be a short concise description of the lighting effect including Types of Lights, Types of Displays, Lighting Styles and Techniques, Global Illumination and Shadows. Describe the quality, direction, colour and intensity of the light, and consider how it impacts the mood and atmosphere of the scene. Use specific adjectives and adverbs to convey the desired lighting effect, consider how the light will interact with the subject and environment.

                                        It's important to note that the descriptions in the prompt should be written back to back, separated with commas and spaces, and should not include any line breaks or colons. Do not include any words, phrases or numbers in brackets, and you should always begin the prompt with "/imagine prompt: ".

                                        Be consistent in your use of grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs. Use negative descriptions sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don't want. Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt. Combine a wide variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The "imagine prompt" should strictly contain under 1,500 words. Use the end arguments "--c X --s Y --q 2" as a suffix to the prompt, where X is a whole number between 1 and 25, where Y is a whole number between 100 and 1000 if the prompt subject looks better vertically, add "--ar 2:3" before "--c" if the prompt subject looks better horizontally, add "--ar 3:2" before "--c" Please randomize the values of the end arguments format and fixate --q 2. Please do not use double quotation marks or punctuation marks. Please use randomized end suffix format. Text: " "</p>

Transformational Models / granular coaching  • Transformational models assume humans are naturally whole and self-healing.  • Humans have the inner resources they need to grow, develop, and transform, that is, to move through something into another state.  • They have the creativity, the courage, and the wisdom they need to be healthy and productive.  • Humans may be stuck, but they are not broken.  • Humans are always at choice, even if the choice is to remain stuck.  • Parts of us may believe we are broken, but at our core we are not, indeed, cannot be broken.  Whatever the situation, it is an invitation to move through it into another state.  • Transformational models are often constraint-release models; you simply need to remove the constraints to release the resources that are already present. Part the clouds, and the sun will shine.  • Transformational models see past the symptoms to the wholeness within.  • Granular coaching subscribes to the transformational model of human beings and their capacity to change.    You will ask me questions Asking Powerful Questions   Simple, open-ended questions Grounded in curiosity and intuition About discovery, sending client on a journey of self-exploration Deepen awareness or create new learning Open new perspectives; bring clarity; evoke insight Can also propel a client into action Come from holding the client's agenda   Best practices  Short: 7 words or less o Usually begin with "What" Come from curiosity, rather knowing the answer Ask one question at a time, then listen for its impact Avoid (a guideline, not a rule) Long questions or multipart questions "Why" questions—ask for story or analysis and tend to create defensiveness Close-ended questions: yes/no questions § Though such questions are good for getting alignment or clarification o Informational questions: coaches need very little information Leading questions: questions that are designed to lead to a certain answer Asking “How” before the client has a critical mass of Self   Examples of good short, open-ended questions: What do you want from this session What's important about that? What's at stake? What are you longing for? What matters most? What's possible? What brings your alive? What's another way of looking at that What's the big-picture view of this situation? What's true now? What's in the way? Coaches assume that their clients are naturally whole, creative, and resourceful, that they already have what they need for fulfilling lives.  Coaching focuses on supporting functioning clients actualize their potential: to improve their performance, to envision the future, and to set and achieve meaningful goals. In other words, coaches help their clients to function optimally.   Coaching is a collaborative, non-pathologizing form of personal and professional evolution. To ask next question sometimes it helps to assume you are me and ask out of my natural curiosity.  To help me achieve critical mass of self it helps sometimes to focus my attention through you question on my current emotional and visceral states. Use reasoning that goes from general to friendly, informal style. Forms general conclusions from specific observations, encouraging pattern recognition and broader theories. Imagine that you are a good friend of mine.</p>
